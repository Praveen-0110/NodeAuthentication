Project Description: Node.js and Express.js Authentication

Overview:
This project aims to build a secure authentication system using Node.js and Express.js. The system will provide functionalities for user registration, login, and logout. Passwords will be securely hashed before storing them in the database to enhance security.

Features:
User Registration: Users can create a new account by providing a username, email, and password. The password will be securely hashed before storing it in the database.

User Login: Registered users can log in using their credentials (username/email and password). The system will authenticate users and generate a session to maintain their login state.

User Logout: Logged-in users can log out, which will destroy their session and invalidate their login state.

Password Hashing: Passwords will be hashed using the bcrypt library before storing them in the database. This ensures that even if the database is compromised, passwords remain secure.

Technologies Used:
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
Express.js: A minimalist web framework for Node.js used to build web applications and APIs.
bcrypt: A library for hashing passwords securely.
HTML/CSS: For creating user interface elements such as registration, login, and logout pages.

Future Enhancements:
Implement password reset functionality.
Add user profile management features.
Incorporate authentication with third-party services like Google or Facebook.
